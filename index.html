        <h1>Data Science modality study</h1>

        <p>
          Greetings !!
          <br />
          <br />
          Welcome to our <b>HUMAN-SE lab</b>. Today, we are going to conduct an
          interesting study on data science. In this study, We are interested to
          know how people learn data science concepts. In our study, we will be
          learning a data science concept, more precisely data cleaning. There
          are many approaches to data cleaning. Today we will be learning about
          outliers and how to remove them from data.
          <br />
          <br />
          First, lets look at the following demo video to understand how we are
          going to run this study.

        <h2>Worked examples</h2>
        <p>
          A worked out example or worked example is a good source to learn a new
          concept. It basically demonstrates the steps required to complete a
          task inorder to solve a problem.
          <br />
          By scaffolding the learning, worked examples support skill acquisition
          and reduce the cognitive load while learning a new topic.
          <br />
          <br />
          For our study , we will be learning about outliers in the form of
          worked examples. We will have different versions of the worked
          examples. So you will have the chance to learn about outliers in
          different ways.
          <br />
          <br />

            Outliers.</b

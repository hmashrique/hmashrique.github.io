        <h1>Data Science Study</h1>

        <p>
          Greetings !!
          <br />
          <br />
          Welcome to our <b>HUMAN-SE lab</b>. Today, we are going to conduct an
          interesting study/experiment on Data Science learning. In this study,
          We are interested to know how people learn Data Science. In our study,
          we will be learning a data science concept, more precisely data
          cleaning. There are different methods of data cleaning, depending on
          what type of cleaning is required. Today, we will be learning about
          outliers and how to remove them from data.
          <br />
          <br />
          During the study, you will go through different steps. Here are the
          stages below at a glance for a brief overview.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Think Aloud Practice</li>
          <li>Learning Data cleaning using Worked Examples</li>
          <li>Isomorphic Problem solving</li>
          <li>Completion problem solving</li>
        </ul>
        Now, lets move to our first step of think aloud practice using the

        <h2>Worked Examples</h2>
        <p>
          A worked out example or worked example is a good source to learn a new
          concept. It basically demonstrates the steps required to complete a
          task inorder to solve a problem.
          <br />
          For our study , we will be learning about outliers in the form of
          worked examples. Using the worked example knowledge, we will apply our
          understanding into some problem-solving similar to the worked example.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Think-Aloud Method</h3>
        <p>
          The Think-Aloud Protocol (TAP) is a research method where participants
          verbalize their thoughts, reasoning, and decision-making processes as
          they perform a task. It is widely used in fields like usability
          testing, cognitive psychology, and design research to understand how
          people interact with systems, make decisions, and solve problems.

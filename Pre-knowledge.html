          What are Outliers?
        </button>
      </p>
      <p>
        In data science, outliers are values within a dataset that vary greatly
        from the others, they are either much larger, or significantly smaller.
        Outliers can appear in a dataset due to variability of measurement,
        error in data, experimental error etc. Outliers can cause machine
        learning models to make inaccurate predictions when they are included in
        the training data, so they need to be handled before training a model.
      </p>

      <p>One of the best ways to understand outliers is box plots.</p>
      <p>
        Boxplots are very useful to see the distribution of a variable/feature
        and detect outliers in them. It is a useful graphical representation for
        describing the behavior of the data in the middle as well as both ends
        of the distribution. A box plot shows the data based on the five-number
        summary:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimum:</strong> the lowest data point in a variable
          excluding any outliers
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Median (Q2 or 50th percentile):</strong> the middle value in
          the variable
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First quartile (Q1 or 25th percentile):</strong>
          also known as the lower quartile (0.25)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third quartile (Q3 or 75th percentile):</strong>
          also known as the upper quartile (0.75)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maximum:</strong> the highest data point in the variable
          excluding any outliers
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="d-inline-flex gap-1">
        <button
          class="btn btn-primary"
          type="button"
          data-bs-toggle="collapse"
          data-bs-target="#collapseiqr"
          aria-expanded="false"
          aria-controls="collapseExample"
        >
          Interquartile Range
        </button>
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between the lower quartile and the upper quartile(Q3 -
        Q1) is called the
        <strong>interquartile range</strong> or <strong>IQR</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boxplots help us find the outliers in the data by using the IQR. As a
        rule, values that are outside the range of 1.5*IQR from Q1 and 1.5*IQR
        from Q3 are regarded as outliers. The below image will help us better
        understand the outliers in our data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="../Boxplot.png"
          alt="boxplot icon"
          width="500"
          height="300"
          style="margin-right: 10px"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the image above, the points that are outside the whisker lines are
        the outliers.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different techniques to handle outliers in a dataset. In our
        example, we will use the concept of <b>clipping (winsorizing)</b>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p class="d-inline-flex gap-1">
        <button
          class="btn btn-primary"
          type="button"
          data-bs-toggle="collapse"
          data-bs-target="#collapseclipping"
          aria-expanded="false"
          aria-controls="collapseExample"
        >
          What is winsorizing/clipping?
        </button>
      </p>
      <p>
        Clipping data from a dataset means to clip the data at the last
        permitted extreme value, e.g. the 5th or 95th percentile value. For
        example, when we clip the data to 95th percentile, values over the 95th
        percentile will be set to the 95th percentile value meaning all the
        values greater than 95% percent will equal to the 95th percentile value.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following data set has several (bolded)
        extremes/outliers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {<strong>0.1, 1,</strong> 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33,
          35, 39, 40, 41, 44, <strong>99, 125</strong>}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After clipping/winsorizing the top and bottom 10% of the data(matching
        those values to the nearest extreme), we get:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {<strong>12, 12,</strong>12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 24, 26, 29, 32, 33,
          35, 39, 40, 41, 44, <strong>44, 44</strong>}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      We will calculate this lower and upper limit by using the winsorizing
      method.
